# Make Me Super

Make Me Super is an application built to enable people to manifest their alter-ego in its purest form. We all have a superhero inside of us, and certain superhero archetypes resonate with us more than others. Make Me Super allows users to become their hero of choice by engaging our list of curated (but customizable) activities - often outside of the average person's comfort zone - that are consistent with their chosen character's experiences, expertise, powers and intent. Anyone can become super, one just has to do the things they've never done to do so.
